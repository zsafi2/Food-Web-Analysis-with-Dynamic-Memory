# Food-Web-Analysis-with-Dynamic-Memory

In this project, food web analysis is performed by taking user-specified predator-prey relationships to build a dynamically allocated struct array of organisms, which is then used to identify the relationships between the organisms in the food web. Then, the analysis is redone after one of the species goes extinct, which requires completely removing that organism from the food web. That is, the array of organisms AND the set of predator-prey relationships must both be rearranged and reallocated to remove all signs of the extinct species.
